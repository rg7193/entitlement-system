# Analysis of Additional Database Components Needed

Based on the example data structure and existing schema, I've identified the following additional database components that would be valuable for the Cash Management Entitlement System:

## Additional Views

1. **client_hierarchy_view** - Shows the complete organizational hierarchy from bank to users
2. **user_entitlements_view** - Shows all entitlements for each user with readable names
3. **account_access_view** - Shows which users have access to which accounts and what operations they can perform
4. **approval_workflow_details_view** - Shows complete approval workflow information with related entities
5. **product_service_hierarchy_view** - Shows the complete product hierarchy with categories, products, and services
6. **user_approval_limits_view** - Shows approval limits for users with product and service details
7. **active_delegations_view** - Shows currently active permission delegations

## Stored Procedures

1. **create_client_hierarchy_proc** - Creates a complete client hierarchy (client group, entity, user groups, users)
2. **grant_permission_proc** - Grants a permission to an entity at a specific level
3. **revoke_permission_proc** - Revokes a permission from an entity
4. **setup_approval_workflow_proc** - Sets up a complete approval workflow with approval groups
5. **delegate_permissions_proc** - Delegates permissions from one user to another
6. **add_user_to_groups_proc** - Adds a user to multiple groups in one operation
7. **audit_permission_changes_proc** - Records permission changes in the audit log

## Utility Functions

1. **get_user_hierarchy_path** - Returns the complete hierarchy path for a user
2. **get_approval_requirements** - Determines approval requirements for a transaction
3. **check_account_access** - Checks if a user has specific access to an account
4. **get_delegated_permissions** - Gets permissions delegated to a user
5. **calculate_effective_approval_limit** - Calculates the effective approval limit for a user
6. **is_in_approval_group** - Checks if a user is in a specific approval group
7. **get_permission_source** - Identifies the source of a user's permission

## Example Queries

1. **User Permission Queries** - Find all permissions for a specific user
2. **Approval Workflow Queries** - Find approval workflows for specific amounts
3. **Client Hierarchy Queries** - Show complete client hierarchies
4. **Product Access Queries** - Show which users have access to specific products
5. **Account Access Queries** - Show which users have access to specific accounts
6. **Delegation Queries** - Show active delegations and their effects
7. **Audit Trail Queries** - Show audit history for specific entities or actions
8. **Approval Limit Queries** - Find users who can approve transactions of specific amounts
9. **Permission Override Queries** - Show where permissions are being overridden
10. **User Group Membership Queries** - Show group memberships and their effects on permissions
